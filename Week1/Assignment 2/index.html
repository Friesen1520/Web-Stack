               <h2>Javascript Basics</h2>
               <p>JavaScript Basics JavaSmipt is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaSmipt is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to lake it in a bunch of different directions. SavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node saver), it can he comusted to the objects of these airdrome. to provide mogrammatic control over </p>
               <ul>
                  <li><a color="#297D8C" href="">Variable Declaration</a> JavaSclipt variables are containers for making data values - iniaMne a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a amiable holds a value. All SavaScriM variables musthe identifial with unique names. Theme unique names are called identifiers. var x</li>
                  <li><a href="">Variable Assignment</a> vanaplo AbSisui Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript vadaMes - our cup aim now have coffee mural in it, giving our variable a value to hold. Tbe w asap.. operator assigns a value to a variable. vas x = 10;</li>
                  <li><a href="">Data types</a> Data types are im important comma to be able to operate on vadables you need to know lbe data type. There are six data Ines that are taxi Script primitives: Boolean - true or false: null- aka nab., Number - 42 or 3.14159; </li>
                  <li><a href="">Conditionals</a> Caodidonale When you "Mite code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - [kWh, different code blocks bastion valuues or conditions that have been met. You min um conditional statements in your cede to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: if a specified condition is InlaidÂ° this code in our code block; else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first conditim is false; else we execute this block of rode:</li>
                  <li><a href="">Loops</a> 11ipribere are many different kids of loops in every mogramming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you runaround the track four times and then you stop. Thais a loop,</li>
                  <li><a href="">Function</a> Function Pureions are im encasmilation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of hmtmctions. As an example imagine we are putting together a de. from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legato the table top; next we place the bade the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sally there are a ton more tables to do so lets mill our function over and over and over again. </li>
